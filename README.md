## Dataset

Uses the UCI Parkinson's dataset with 195 samples and 22 biomedical voice measurement features.
Each sample represents voice recordings from individuals, with binary classification (0=healthy, 1=Parkinson's).

## Technical Implementation

- **Data Processing**: Custom train/test split with stratification
- **Feature Selection**: Correlation-based ranking with configurable k-best selection
- **Scaling**: Z-score normalization using training statistics
- **Model Training**: Grid search hyperparameter optimization
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics including confusion matrix analysis
